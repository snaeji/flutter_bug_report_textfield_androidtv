# Keyboard-focus-bug

Example project showing how we loose the focus to navigate after text input on Android TV.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Tap "Open text input" button
2. Enter some text and tap the search icon
3. Navigate up and down buttons
4. Repeat

After 3-4 repetitions the traversal fails and the keyboard randomly appears.
